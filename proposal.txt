I ran this project by Prof Goldschmidt, and he said it was all good:

I'm working with the developer of Neural-MMO [1] to assist in logging
and visualizing simluation data, namely training data (reward values,
iteration time, etc) and market data. We are using Bokeh [2] for visualization
and Ray [3] for distributed computing. I'm hoping by the end of this
semester to create an interactive dashboard that can save and load 
data from a file to allow users to view a run of an experiment.
